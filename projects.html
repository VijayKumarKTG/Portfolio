          <dt>Situation</dt>
          <dd>
            On September 10, 2020, a senior from my university called me to work
            on a project as a front end developer. The app had back end and I
            had to complete the front end until the end of the September. So, I
            accpeted the project.
          </dd>
          <dt>Task</dt>
          <dd>
            I had to work on fron end using ReactJS, React-Router,
            styled-components and Axios. I finished the front end on time but
            later the client wanted to add more features. So, I ended up makng
            the whole web app 100% customizable from an admin dashboard which
            client will control. Then, had to created the admin dashboard itself
            using react-admin. Later, added Facebook Graph API so that users can
            view organization's Facebook post on the web app. To accomodate all
            of the above features, I had to make changes in the back end using
            NodeJS and Express.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            I easily developed the front end but I had to learn how to use
            react-router for all the routings and axios to make HTTPS requests.
            I also read about react-admin and wathced some tutorials to make the
            admin board. There were problems in the react-admin and I had to
            customise it as users requirements. I developed the admin dashboard
            by learning, fixing and debugging. I was so frustrated of the
            react-admin but I made sure I'll do my best and I did created the
            admin board. After this, I moved to work on setting up facebook
            developer account for the client web app and integrated it into the
            app. I had to change some old back-end to meet the new user
            requirements. Finally, I had to deploy it on Heroku until I relized
            that I had no experience deploying MERN stack app. So, I learned
            about it and deployed it successfully.
          </dd>
          <dt>Result</dt>
          <dd>
            In result, I launched my first cleint MERN stack app. I handovered
            all of the project related documentations and guides to the client.
            I learned new technologies and API like React-Router, Axios and
            Facebook Graph API respectively. I learned about basic MERN stack
            even without doing any specific course on it. Besides from these, I
            learned more about how to handle my tasks, frustrations and stress
            when encounter errors, and how to communicate with respectful
            straight messages.

        <h2 class="project__heading">The Tarzan Way: Form System</h2>
        <dl class="project__star">
          <dt>Situation</dt>
          <dd>
            I was looking for online internship and I found a front end
            internship from a travel startup called The Tarzan Way. This was a
            young startup from Noida, India. I applied it, cleared the interview
            and then just dived into the project.
          </dd>
          <dt>Task</dt>
          <dd>
            I was assigned to create some forms related with different clients
            and partners using ReactJS. Later my CTO and my senior front end
            developer told me that I had to create a form system which takes a
            JSON schema and generates a full-fledged form based on that JSON. It
            was something new and challenging for me. At first I was nervous
            about it but later it became exciting to work on that.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            I started creating a static form but with custom react input
            components. Then, developed a multi-step layout generator for long
            forms by learning online and some code reviews. I need to make the
            form to handle inputs, validations, HTTPS requests and responses
            from the server. At first, I created some components from online
            codes and refactored the codes using best practices. Later, I
            started creating all of the components on my own with my logic. I
            composed all of the components and features into the form system.
            Then, documented the whole system using "Docz".
          </dd>
          <dt>Result</dt>
          <dd>
            Created a dynamic form system which takes JSON and generates forms.
            Those forms handle inputs, validation, error handling and all the
            accessibility design and best practices. After completing the
            internship, I got more insights of how to work effectively in an
            organization, using different tools like Slack, Github and Jira.
            Learned to believe in myself and in my skills and worked
            collaboratively in an organization with the organization's vision
            and mission.

            I was scrolling through the twitter and saw a tweet in which people
            are invited to participate in an open-source project called Debbie.
            This one was my first contribution to an open-source project. I
            considered to participate in this “Debbie” project and I just
            commented down that tweet and later, got the links to the discord
            server.
          </dd>
          <dt>Task</dt>
          <dd>
            All the project members started working on the projects. The leader
            open issues and made a Kanban for the project. We were free to work
            on any issue of our interest. The main focus of this project was to
            develop a service which helps people with chronic pain to record
            their everyday pain level and shows their records daily, weekly and
            monthly basis. Currently, the only the web app is available and
            later, we have planned to extend the web app and we will develop the
            app into other versions like flutter, react, and also will integrate
            Google Assistant and Alexa.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            After a couple of days, I started to choose from issues on which I
            want to contribute. Firstly, I chose the user story for sign up and
            landing page. I work with a very nice peer from Spain. Then, I
            worked with the designing of sign up page with another colleague
            from India. Thirdly, I work with the project initiator on the
            cleaning up and refactoring of the web app codes. And in finally, I
            was assigned to work on the backend issues of the “Debbie” project.
          </dd>
          <dt>Result</dt>
          <dd>
            We launched the web app version of the "Debbie" project at the end
            of August. I got a lot more from doing this project. As I mentioned
            before, this was my first open-source project, I became familiar
            with how to work on a project with many exciting people from around
            the world. How to communicate effectively, how to solve an issue
            with the group, and how to manage time to work on my chores. In the
            technical skills, I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
            and GitHub, Node.js, NPM, Express and MongoDB. This is my second
            work on a full-stack app after the Yelp Camp app.

            I started learning web development after an introductory course in
            the first year of the University. I wanted to learn the core
            concepts of both front end and back end development. I found Colt
            Steele’s “The Web Developer Bootcamp”. Whilst working through his
            course I developed this project.
          </dd>
          <dt>Task</dt>
          <dd>
            This was a project to develop a full-stack web app on which people
            can share about a camp they have been with other people. Anyone can
            comment, add campground info and create their account on the web app
            and a lot more.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            I started coding together with an instructor while learning the
            concepts of full-stack web dev, routing in express, NodeJS, and
            MongoDB.

          <dt>Result</dt>
          <dd>
            At the end of the course, I had a full-stack web app called Yelp
            Camp. Then, following my certificate from the course, I continued
            adding new features and some design changes. I have since completing
            this added a lot of new features.

          <dd>
            I have been working through Free Code Camp challenges for one and a
            half years. I wanted to practice my full-stack web development. In
            addition to this, I have also worked on projects from front-end
            mentor, I use this platform to develop my design, HTML, CSS and some
            basic JavaScript skills.
          </dd>
          <dt>Task</dt>
          <dd>
            In the FCC my focus is to work on a certain number of challenges in
            each section. After completing those challenges, I complete at least
            5 small real-world projects. I have found it invaluable that
            front-end mentor provides me with a simple template and assets like
            images and design of a certain challenge. I have to accomplish the
            design with any front-end related framework I consider suitable.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            I began working on these challenges one-by-one and completed all my
            certificates. I'm still doing FCC and front-end mentor challenges.
            As all developers do, I often research challenges to get more
            insight into the challenge concepts.
          </dd>
          <dt>Result</dt>
          <dd>
            Finally, I now have 5 certificates from the FCC and completed 11
            challenges from front-end mentor. I have gained a lot of knowledge
            and also become familiar with tools like slack and github because of
            front-end mentor slack group. I have collaborated with other
            students to deliver these projects as well as continue by
            contributing to open source projects.

                <dt>Situation</dt>
                <dd>After finishing the reading of the book called "Road To React", I wanted to do some practice to
                    apply my fresh learnings from that book. So I decided to make a start with a to-do app which most
                    react beginners do.</dd>
                <dt>Task</dt>
                <dd>I wanted to apply my react skills so my focus was mostly to know more about how state and props
                    work, the controlled components, lifecycle methods and ES6 also. So, the ultimate focus was to
                    develop a simple to-do app with CRUD, completed to-do and filters.</dd>
                <dt>Action</dt>
                <dd>I just started with create-react-app and made a static to-do at first. I did some stylings on the
                    static to do. Later, I added the data flow with states and props. While developing, did some
                    debugging using react dev tool and also did snapshot testing and unit testing with Jest.</dd>
                <dt>Result</dt>
                <dd>Finally, got the app I wanted but the coding was difficult for me since it was the first react
                    project with the help of some googling, of course. I learned that my coding is still bad in react;
                    get some basic knowledge of underlying concepts. Also, become familiar with why testing is important
                    and why developers do this.</dd>

                <dt>Situation</dt>
                <dd>I was scrolling through the twitter and saw a tweet in which people are invited to participate in an
                    open-source project called Debbie. This one was my first contribution to an open-source project. I
                    considered to participate in this “Debbie” project and I just commented down that tweet and later,
                    got the links to the discord server.</dd>
                <dt>Task</dt>
                <dd>All the project members started working on the projects. The leader open issues and made a Kanban
                    for the project. We were free to work on any issue of our interest. The main focus of this project
                    was to develop a service which helps people with chronic pain to record their everyday pain level
                    and shows their records daily, weekly and monthly basis. Currently, the only the web app is
                    available and later, we have planned to extend the web app and we will develop the app into other
                    versions like flutter, react, and also will integrate Google Assistant and Alexa.</dd>
                <dt>Action</dt>
                <dd>After a couple of days, I started to choose from issues on which I want to contribute. Firstly, I
                    chose the user story for sign up and landing page. I work with a very nice peer from Spain. Then, I
                    worked with the designing of sign up page with another colleague from India. Thirdly, I work with
                    the project initiator on the cleaning up and refactoring of the web app codes. And in finally, I was
                    assigned to work on the backend issues of the “Debbie” project.</dd>
                <dt>Result</dt>
                <dd>We launched the web app version of the "Debbie" project at the end of August. I got a lot more from
                    doing this project. As I mentioned before, this was my first open-source project, I became familiar
                    with how to work on a project with many exciting people from around the world. How to communicate
                    effectively, how to solve an issue with the group, and how to manage time to work on my chores. In
                    the technical skills, I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub, Node.js, NPM,
                    Express and MongoDB. This is my second work on a full-stack app after the Yelp Camp app. </dd>

                <dt>Situation</dt>
                <dd>I started learning web development after its introductory story in the first year of the University.
                    I wanted to know the core concepts of both front end and back end and I found Colt Steele’s “The Web
                    Developer Bootcamp”. I developed this project during that boot camp on Udemy.</dd>
                <dt>Task</dt>
                <dd>We have to develop a full-stack web app on which people can share about a camp they have been with
                    other people; anyone can comment, add campground info and create their account on the web app and a
                    lot more.</dd>
                <dt>Action</dt>
                <dd>I started coding with the instructor while learning the concepts of full-stack web dev, routing in
                    express, NodeJS, and MongoDB.</dd>
                <dt>Result</dt>
                <dd>At the end of the course, we had a full-stack web app called Yelp Camp. Then, after I got the
                    certificate from the course, I continued adding new features and some design changes. Now, have the
                    app with a lot more features.</dd>

                <dt>Situation</dt>
                <dd>I have been doing Free Code Camp challenges for 1 and half year. I wanted to practices related to
                    full-stack web development. So I found this platform before any other platforms. In the case of
                    front-end mentor, I use this platform to develop my designing, HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript
                    skills.</dd>
                <dt>Task</dt>
                <dd>What I have to do in the FCC is to work on a certain number of challenges in each section. After
                    completing those challenges, I have to complete at least 5 small real-world projects. Then, after
                    completing all the challenges and projects in a section, I'll get a certificate for free. Where
                    front-end mentor provides me with a simple template and assets like images and design of a certain
                    challenge. I have to accomplish the design with any front-end related technology.</dd>
                <dt>Action</dt>
                <dd>I began working on these challenges one-by-one and got my certificates. I'm still doing FCC and
                    front-end mentor challenges. Do google search on some challenges and do some more research to get
                    more insight into the challenge concepts.</dd>
                <dt>Result</dt>
                <dd>Finally, I now have four certificates from the FCC and completed 11 challenges from front-end
                    mentor. I got a lot more knowledge and become used to with slack because of front-end mentor slack
                    group. I started getting help and helping others in the slack group.</dd>
